# Expire-Password-Protected-Pages
Contributors: troyglancy
Tags: security, password protected pages
Requires at least: 3.7
This plugin will require vistior to type in password each time when visiting a password protected page. This will prevent the page from being accessable if someone logins via a public computer. By default Wordpress password protected pages sessions will last 10 days. You could add this code via your funtion.php within your theme but I didn't want the code to get overwritten when doing a theme update. Using this plugin avoids the need for updating the funtion.php.
