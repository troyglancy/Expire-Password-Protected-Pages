Requires at least: 3.7

Description: It's a really simple plugin but does the job. This plugin will require visitor to type in the password each time they are visiting a password protected page. By default WordPress password protected pages sessions will last 10 days. Originally came up with this idea when a client did not want a password protected pages to stay login. While you could add the code to your function.php within your theme I did not want the code to get overwritten when doing a theme update. Using this plugin avoids the need for updating the function.php file. 

Once you have it uploaded to your WordPress install. Simply login to your Wordpress backend and activate the plugin. After it's activated you no longer need to do anything. You can test the page by refreshing the page after typing the password or closing your browser. Once you visit the page again it will force you to type in the password.

Please note: If you use a cache plugin it may cause the plugin to not work correctly. Please whitelist the page you're password protecting within your cache plugin.

You can use this plugin by downloading and unzippping it to the /plugin directory. Once you have it uploaded to your web host login to your Wordpress backend and activate the plugin. After it's activated you no longer need to do anything.
